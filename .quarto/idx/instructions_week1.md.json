{"title":"Portfolio Setup Instructions","markdown":{"headingText":"Portfolio Setup Instructions","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nWelcome to MUSA 5080! This guide will help you set up your personal portfolio repository for the semester.\n\n## What You're Building\n\nBy the end of this setup, you'll have:\n- Your own portfolio repository on GitHub\n-  live website showcasing your work\n- A place to document your learning journey\n\n## Example:\n\n- This is what you are building: **[Dr. Delmelle's sample portfolio](https://ecdelmelle.github.io/MUSA-5080-instructor-portfolio/)** \n  \n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting, make sure you have:\n- [ ] A GitHub account ([create one here](https://github.com/join) if needed)\n- [ ] Quarto installed on your computer ([download here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/))\n- [ ] R and RStudio installed\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Customize Your Repository\n\nYou should already be in your personal repository (created when you accepted the GitHub Classroom assignment). Now let's personalize it!\n\n#### 1.1 Edit Your Site Title\n1. Click on the `_quarto.yml` file\n2. Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit\n3. Change `\"Your Name - MUSA 5080 Portfolio\"` to include your actual name\n4. Example: `\"Jane Smith - MUSA 5080 Portfolio\"`\n5. Click **\"Commit changes\"** at the bottom\n\n#### 1.2 Update Your Homepage\n1. Click on the `index.qmd` file\n2. Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit\n3. Update the **\"About Me\"** section with your information:\n   - Your name and background\n   - Your email address\n   - Your GitHub username\n   - Why you're taking this course\n4. Click **\"Commit changes\"**\n\n#### 1.3 Complete Your First Weekly Notes\n1. Navigate to the `weekly-notes` folder\n2. Click on `week-01-notes.qmd`\n3. Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit\n4. Fill in your notes from the first class\n5. Click **\"Commit changes\"**\n\n### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages\n\nThis step makes your portfolio visible as a live website!\n\n1. **Go to Settings**: Click the \"Settings\" tab at the top of your repository\n2. **Find Pages**: Scroll down and click \"Pages\" in the left sidebar\n3. **Configure Source**: \n   - Source: Select \"Deploy from a branch\"\n   - Branch: Select \"main\" \n   - Folder: Select \"/ docs\"\n4. **Save**: Click \"Save\"\n5. **Wait**: GitHub will show a message that your site is being built (this takes 1-5 minutes)\n\n### Step 3: Test Your Website\n\n1. **Find Your URL**: After a few minutes, GitHub will show your website URL at the top of the Pages settings\n   - It will look like: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`\n2. **Visit Your Site**: Click the link to see your live portfolio!\n3. **Bookmark It**: Save this URL - you'll submit it to Canvas\n\n### Step 4: Submit to Canvas\n\n1. Copy your live website URL\n2. Go to the Canvas assignment\n3. Submit your URL\n\n## Working on Your Portfolio Locally (Optional but Recommended)\n\nIf you want to work on your computer and see changes before publishing:\n\n### Clone Your Repository\n```bash\n# Replace [your-repo-url] with your actual repository URL\ngit clone [your-repo-url]\ncd [your-repository-name]\n```\n\n### Make Changes and Preview\n```bash\n# Edit your files using RStudio\n# Preview your changes:\nquarto render\nquarto preview\n\n# When ready, save your changes:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Update portfolio\"\ngit push\n```\n\nYour live website will automatically update when you push changes!\n\n## Weekly Workflow\n\nEach week you'll:\n1. Create a new file: `weekly-notes/week-XX-notes.qmd`\n2. Copy the template from `week-01-notes.qmd`\n3. Fill in your reflections and key concepts\n4. Commit and push your changes\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### My website isn't showing up\n- **Wait longer**: GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to build\n- **Check Actions tab**: Look for any red X marks indicating build failures\n- **Verify Pages settings**: Make sure you selected \"main\" branch and \"/docs\" folder\n\n### I can't edit files\n- **Check permissions**: Make sure you're in YOUR repository, not the template\n- **Sign in**: Ensure you're signed into GitHub\n\n### My Quarto site won't render\n- **Check YAML syntax**: Make sure your `_quarto.yml` file has proper formatting\n- **Verify file names**: Files should end in `.qmd` not `.md`\n- **Look at error messages**: The Actions tab will show specific error details\n\n### I made a mistake\n- **Don't panic!** Every change is tracked in Git\n- **See history**: Click the \"History\" button on any file to see previous versions\n- **Revert changes**: You can always go back to a previous version\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. **Commit often**: Save your work frequently with descriptive commit messages\n2. **Use branches**: For major changes, create a new branch and merge when ready\n3. **Preview locally**: Use `quarto preview` to see changes before publishing\n4. **Keep it professional**: This portfolio can be shared with future employers!\n5. **Document everything**: Good documentation is as important as good analysis\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/)\n- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)\n- [Git Tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)\n\n## Getting Help\n\n**During Class:**\n- Raise your hand for immediate help\n- Work with classmates - collaboration is encouraged for setup!\n\n**Outside Class:**\n- **Office Hours**: Mondays 1:30-3:00 PM\n- **Email**: delmelle@design.upenn.edu\n- **GitHub Issues**: Create an issue in your repository for technical problems\n- **Canvas Discussion**: Post questions others might have too\n\n## Checklist\n\nBefore submitting, make sure you've:\n- [ ] Customized `_quarto.yml` with your name\n- [ ] Updated `index.qmd` with your information\n- [ ] Completed Week 1 notes\n- [ ] Enabled GitHub Pages\n- [ ] Verified your website loads correctly\n- [ ] Submitted your URL to Canvas\n\n---\n\n*Need help?

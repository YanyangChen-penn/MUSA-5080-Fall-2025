Unlike private-sector data science focused solely on\noptimization, our approach emphasizes public goods, governance, and\nequity. We'll cover topics including transportation, housing, public\nhealth, and criminal justice, using both spatial tools and predictive\nmodeling to help guide resource allocation and policy design.\n\n**Key Focus:** Understanding concepts deeply rather than just completing\ncode. We emphasize fairness, transparency, and understanding the\nimplications of our models.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the semester, students will be able to:\n\n-   Build and evaluate predictive models for public policy questions\n-   Critically assess model generalizability, effectiveness, and bias\\\n-   Navigate the full data science workflow: wrangling, exploration,\n    modeling, and communication\n-   Integrate spatial and temporal variables into policy-oriented models\n-   Communicate uncertainty, limitations, and equity impacts to\n    decision-makers\n-   Create professional data science portfolios using Quarto\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Course Materials\n\n### Required Texts (All Free Online)\n\n-   Ken Steif, [*Public Policy\n    Analytics*](https://urbanspatial.github.io/PublicPolicyAnalytics/)\n-   Hadley Wickham et al., [*R for Data\n    Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)\n-   Robin Lovelace et al., [*Geocomputation with\n    R*](https://r.geocompx.org/)\n-   Kyle Walker, [*Analyzing US Census\n    Data*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/)\n\n### Supplemental Material\n\n-   Selected chapters from [*Visualization for Social Data\n    Science*](https://vis4sds.github.io/vis4sds/)\n-   Additional readings provided weekly via Canvas\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Assessment Structure\n\n| Component | Weight | Description |\n|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Weekly In-Class Quizzes** | 35% | Concept-focused assessments (10 quizzes, lowest score dropped) |\n| **Lab Assignments (5 total)** | 20% | Implementation + feedback response graded on 3-point scale |\n| **Midterm: House Prediction Competition** | 15% | Team-based modeling competition with lightning presentations |\n| **Final Modeling Challenge** | 25% | Real-world policy problem requiring model selection and justification |\n| **Participation & Weekly Notes** | 5% | Attendance, engagement, and weekly learning documentation |\n\n### Lab Assignment Structure\n\n**Philosophy:** Lab assignments assess coding implementation,\ndocumentation, and professional response to feedback. Knowledge of\nunderlying concepts is evaluated through weekly quizzes. Ultimately, the\nlabs will form your final portfolio for this course so the amount of\neffort you put into each assignment is for your own benefit.\n\n**Lab Assignment Structure:**\n\nLabs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are individual assignments. **Lab 3 (House\nPrediction)** is completed in teams of 3-4 students.\n\n**Assignment Sequence:**\n\n1.  **Census Data Exploration** (Individual)\n2.  **Neighborhood Indicators** (Individual)\n3.  **House Price Prediction Competition** (Team-based) - *Serves as\n    Midterm*\n4.  **Parole Reform Analysis** - Logistic Regression (Individual)\n5.  **Bike Share Rebalancing** - Space-Time Modeling (Individual)\n\n**Final Modeling Challenge:** Teams work on a real-world policy problem\nand choose the most appropriate modeling approach from the semester\n(linear regression, count models, logistic regression, or space-time\nmodeling). The challenge emphasizes problem framing, methodology\njustification, and complete workflow implementation.\n\n**GitHub-Based Feedback Response:** Each assignment (after the first)\nmust include a `feedback-response.md` file addressing: - How you\nincorporated previous TA feedback - Specific improvements made to visual\nclarity of figures, documentation, writeups - Challenges encountered and\nsolutions attempted - Questions or areas needing clarification\n\n**Weekly Notes Requirement:** Students maintain a `weekly-notes/` folder\nin their GitHub repo with files named `week-XX-notes.md`. Notes should\ninclude: - Key concepts from lecture and readings - Coding techniques\nlearned and challenges faced - Questions or confusion points -\nConnections to previous weeks or policy applications - Personal\nreflections on the material\n\n*Notes are checked weekly for completion and effort (not accuracy) and\nserve as quiz preparation aids.*\n\n**Lab Grading Scale:**\n\n-   **2 points:** Complete implementation + feedback incorporation +\n    clear documentation.\n-   **1 point:** Somewhat complete, poor feedback integration or unclear\n    work\n-   **0 points:** Not submitted, incomplete, or no evidence of engaging\n    with feedback\n\n**Weekly Quiz:** AI advancements have changed how I view assessment. I\nam no longer concerned about students ability to complete coding-based\nassignments. AI, while certainly not perfect, will generally produce a\nsolution to assignment prompts. My major concern now is how well\nstudents are able to really comprehend the concepts and fundamentals of\nwhat is being done in order to be appropriate critics of what AI\nproduces.\n\nTherefore, each class period will begin with an in-person, written quiz\non material from the prior week or the prior lab assignment. There will\nbe a total of 10 quizzes, but I will drop the lowest one.\n\n## Course Format\n\n**Structure:** Each 3-hour session combines conceptual lectures with\nhands-on labs\n\n**Expectations:**\n\n-   Bring charged laptops for live coding and group work\n-   Maintain weekly Quarto-based portfolio with reflections and notes\n    (*ideally* students will take written notes and then transfer these\n    to quarto after class for optimal retainment.)\n-   Revise past work based on TA feedback for portfolio improvement\n-   Engage actively in discussions and collaborative problem-solving\n-   Attend class!\n\n**Technology:** All work will be completed in R using Quarto for\nreproducible, professional documentation.\n\n**GitHub Classroom:** We will use GitHub Classroom for assignment\ndistribution and submission. Each assignment creates a personal\nrepository containing starter materials and instructions. Students\ncustomize, complete, and push their work to GitHub. This workflow builds\nprofessional version control skills while enabling efficient feedback\nand collaboration.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Weekly Schedule\n\n| Week | Date | Topic | Assessment | Lab Assignment | GitHub Deliverables |\n|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| 1 | Sep 8 | Course Intro • Quarto & GitHub Setup • R Review | — | Setup & Portfolio Init | Initial repo + Week 1 notes |\n| 2 | Sep 15 | Census Data + Wrangling • Basic Visualization | Q1 | **Lab 1 Start:** Census Exploration | Week 2 notes + Lab 1 progress |\n| 3 | Sep 22 | EDA • Visual Design Foundations | Q2 | Lab 1 continued | Week 3 notes + Lab 1 progress |\n| 4 | Sep 29 | Spatial Operations • Neighborhood Indicators | Q3 | **Lab 1 Due** + **Lab 2 Start** | Week 4 notes + Lab 1 final + Lab 2 start |\n| 5 | Oct 6 | Linear Regression I • Making Predictions | Q4 | Lab 2 continued | Week 5 notes + Lab 2 progress |\n| 6 | Oct 13 | Linear Regression II • Model Evaluation | Q5 | **Lab 2 Due** + **Lab 3 Start** (Teams) | Week 6 notes + Lab 2 final + Lab 3 start |\n| 7 | Oct 20 | Spatial Autocorrelation • Intro to Spatial ML | Q5 | **Lab 3 Continue** (Teams) | Week 7 notes + Lab 2 final + Lab 3 start |\n| 8 | Oct 27 | **House Prediction Presentations** + Count Models-Predictive Policing | **Competition Presentations** | **Lab 3 Due** | Week 8 notes + Lab 3 final + presentations |\n| 9 | Nov 3 | Logistic Regression I • Geographic Cross-Validation | Q6 |  | Week 9 notes |\n| 10 | Nov 10 | Logistic Regression II • Recidivism Case Study | Q7 | **Lab 4 Start:** Parole Reform Analysis | Week 10 notes + Lab 4 start |\n| 11 | Nov 17 | Space-Time Modeling • Temporal Analysis | Q8 | **Lab 4 Due** + **Lab 5 Start:** Bike Share | Week 11 notes + Lab 4 final + Lab 5 start |\n| 12 | Nov 24 | Text Analysis + \\*k\\*-means clustering.
